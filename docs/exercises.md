# Exercises Overview

Every project is designed for undergraduates who are new to full-stack development. Each assignment is introduced during class and always due on a Tuesday to avoid weekend crunch.

**Single monorepo + EX3 free cloud deployment:** Students maintain one Git repository for **EX1**, **EX2**, and **EX3** (keep each exercise in clearly labeled folders or services). Only the **EX3** deliverable must go online: deploy the entire Docker Compose stack (backend, frontend, nginx/Redis, and any extra services) on a single Azure for Students compute instance using the \$100 credit (no credit card required). Monitor usage closely so you never spend beyond the grant, and budget time to record a ‚â§3 min demo movie showing the live deployment for graders.

## EX1 ‚Äì Backend Foundations
- **Assigned:** Monday, Nov 10, 2025
- **Due:** Tuesday, Dec 2, 2025 at 23:59 (Israel time)
- **Goal:** Build a FastAPI movie service that supports create/read/update/delete operations and records ratings.
- **Sessions to revisit:** [Session 02 ‚Äì Introduction to HTTP and REST](sessions/session-02.md), [Session 03 ‚Äì FastAPI Fundamentals](sessions/session-03.md), [Session 04 ‚Äì Docker Basics and Reverse Proxy Demo](sessions/session-04.md).
- **Required Features:**
  - Endpoints: `POST /movies`, `GET /movies`, `GET /movies/{id}`, `PUT /movies/{id}`, `DELETE /movies/{id}`, plus `POST /ratings` for new scores.
  - Validation via `pydantic` models (title/year/genre, rating score 1‚Äì5).
  - Automated tests using pytest and FastAPI‚Äôs `TestClient`.
  - Dockerfile using uv to install dependencies.
  - README documenting setup, run commands, and any AI assistance.
- **Rubric (100 pts):** correctness 35, validation/errors 15, automated tests 20, Dockerization 15, documentation/code style 15.

## EX2 ‚Äì Frontend Integration
- **Assigned:** Monday, Dec 1, 2025
- **Due:** Tuesday, Dec 23, 2025 at 23:59 (Israel time)
- **Goal:** Create a movie dashboard UI that interacts with the EX1 API (list catalogue, submit ratings).
- **Sessions to revisit:** [Session 05 ‚Äì Movie Service Persistence with SQLite](sessions/session-05.md), [Session 06 ‚Äì Movie Dashboards with Streamlit & React](sessions/session-06.md), [Session 07 ‚Äì Testing, Logging, and Profiling Basics](sessions/session-07.md).
- **Choices:**
  - Streamlit (fast path, Python-based).
  - Minimal React app (JavaScript-based) using Vite.
- **Required Features:**
  - List existing movies (title/year/genre/average rating) from the API.
  - Create new movies and submit ratings.
  - Update and delete movies (via controls) and show top movies.
  - Handle error states (failed fetch, validation errors, unauthorised requests).
  - README with setup steps, including how to run both the API and the UI.
- **Optional Stretch (+10 pts):** Integrate the UI into Docker Compose so one command starts both services.
- **Rubric (100 pts):** feature completeness 35, user experience 15, error handling 15, code quality/organization 15, documentation 10, optional Compose integration +10 bonus.

## EX3 ‚Äì Advanced Backend + Compose
- **Assigned:** Monday, Jan 5, 2026
- **Milestone Demo:** Tuesday, Jan 20, 2026 (in-class show-and-tell)
- **Final Due:** Tuesday, Feb 10, 2026 at 23:59 (Israel time)
- **Goal:** Deliver a multi-service stack using Docker Compose and one advanced capability.
- **Sessions to revisit:** [Session 08 ‚Äì Working with AI Coding Assistants](sessions/session-08.md), [Session 09 ‚Äì Async Recommendation Refresh](sessions/session-09.md), [Session 10 ‚Äì Docker Compose, Redis, and Service Contracts](sessions/session-10.md), [Session 11 ‚Äì Security Foundations](sessions/session-11.md), [Session 12 ‚Äì Tool-Friendly APIs and Final Prep](sessions/session-12.md).
- **Required Services:** at least the FastAPI API and an nginx reverse proxy. Optional additional services include databases, frontends, or monitoring tools.
- **Advanced Feature Choices (pick one):**
  1. Asynchronous recommendation rebuild job (Session 09).
  2. Authentication/authorization (JWT-based, roles, protected routes).
  3. Observability (metrics endpoint, structured logs, or tracing).
- **Deliverables:**
  - Working Compose stack (`docker compose up --build` runs without errors) with API, Redis cache, and nginx proxy.
  - Automated tests covering the advanced feature.
  - README including architecture diagram or description, environment variables, deployment URL/steps, Azure credit tracking notes, and AI usage documentation.
  - Cloud deployment of the Compose stack on the Azure for Students free tier. Run everything on a single compute instance, stay within the \$100 grant, and follow the [Azure Container Apps Deployment Playbook](../deployments/azure-container-apps.md); document the exact commands, resource names, public URLs, credit usage, and teardown steps you used.
  - Verification evidence: demonstrate the stack works locally **and** in Azure. Record a short unlisted YouTube demo movie (‚â§3 min) of the live cloud deployment in action, include the link in the README, and capture logs or screenshots from a successful local `docker compose up --build`.
  - Optional: expose a tool-friendly endpoint and demonstrate calling it from a script or local LLM (Session 08 covers LM Studio + vLLM setup).
- **Rubric (100 pts):** multi-service architecture 25, advanced feature depth 30, reliability/resilience 15, tests 15, documentation 15.

> üîÅ **Demo checklist:** run through the playbook end-to-end the week before submission so the grading team can access your site. Bring screenshots of the Azure Portal resource group, the `docker-compose.release.yml`, the Cost Management credit balance, a successful browser session pointed at your live URL, and have your unlisted YouTube demo link ready.

# Engineering at Scale – 12 Session Plan

Welcome! This site hosts the 12-week plan for the EASS course reboot. Everything is organized around short theory bursts followed by two hands-on blocks so undergrads can follow step by step.

- Classes meet on **Mondays** from Nov 3, 2025 through Jan 19, 2026.
- Each meeting has **45 min theory** + **45 min hands-on build** + **45 min practice/extension**.
- Exercises are assigned in class and always due on a **Tuesday** to give students time after the weekend.

> **Heads-up from Andrej Karpathy**  
> - Sleep beats all-nighters; aim for ~7½ hours before big work.  
> - Meet the material early and often—short sessions across days stick best.  
> - Try problems without notes so you know you can re-create the steps.  
> - Teach someone else what you learned; explaining makes it click.  
> - Visit office hours and sessions even if you only have small questions.  
> - Stop studying alone near the end—compare notes and fill gaps with peers.  
> - Never hand in early on tests; use every minute to check for silly misses.  
> - Grades matter, but real projects and references matter more—build things outside class.

## Teaching Philosophy
- Keep examples tiny and copy/paste friendly.
- Repeat concepts using the whiteboard sketches described in each session and the Natalie reference notes in `lectures/notes/`.
- Keep external work aligned: remind students about AWS Academy module deadlines and Discord support channels during class.
- Encourage question “warm-ups”: students share what they tried before asking for help.

Happy teaching!

# Archived Slide Decks

This folder keeps the legacy materials from earlier editions of the course. They are preserved for reference but are no longer the primary teaching assets.

## Contents
- `all_slides.pdf` – Full slide deck from the previous version of the class.
- `slides_part_a.md`, `slides_part_b.md` – Markdown exports of the 2022 lectures.
- `legacy/` – Additional historical PDFs and support files.
- `Makefile` – Original build script for generating the old slides.

Use these files if you need to revisit older examples or migrate specific slides into the refreshed 12-session plan. All new sessions are scripted directly in `docs/sessions/` so students do not need these decks to follow along.

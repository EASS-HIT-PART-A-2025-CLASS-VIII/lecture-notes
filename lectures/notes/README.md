# Natalieâ€™s Notes

`EASS-Complete-Natalie.pdf` collects the detailed reference notes prepared by Natalie. They complement the new 12-session scripts and are great for:
- Quick command lookups (Bash, Docker, Git).
- Deeper dives into security, networking, and debugging topics.
- Extra practice ideas for students who finish labs early.

Keep this PDF available to instructors but do not rely on it as the primary lecture script. The updated, self-contained plans live in `docs/sessions/`.
